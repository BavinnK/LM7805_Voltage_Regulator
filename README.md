# LM7805 Voltage Regulator Circuit

This repository contains a 5V voltage regulator circuit using the **LM7805** IC, designed on a breadboard and simulated in Tinkercad

## Features
- Converts higher DC voltage (e.g., 9V–12V) to a stable 5V output.
- Uses **ceramic capacitors (0.1 µF)** and **electrolytic capacitors (10 µF)** for noise filtering.
- Includes a **multimeter measurement** to verify current output.

## Components Used
- **LM7805 Voltage Regulator**
- **10µF Electrolytic Capacitors (x2)**
- **0.1µF Ceramic Capacitors (x2)**
- **Resistors**
- **LED Indicator**
- **Multimeter for measurement**


## How to Use
1. Connect a ** more than 7.5 volts  power source** to the input.
2. Observe a stable **5V output** at the regulator’s output pin.
3. Use a multimeter to measure voltage stability.

## Future Improvements
- Add a **heat sink** to LM7805 for better efficiency.
- Design a **PCB version** of the circuit.
- Test with different loads.
